# Introduction

This code is the source code of the SparkFun OpenLog Artemis. This has been ripped straight out of the github: https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog_Artemis. This has been changed to recognize multiple gps's.

AutoDetect.ino and sensor.ino are the 2 files that were edited to recognize multiple GPS.
